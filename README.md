# Fox-V3-fixes

These are unofficial fixes for cogs by Bobloy. The original repo and README.md are at: https://github.com/bobloy/Fox-V3

Only a small subset of those cogs are fixed in this clone. They are provided without warranty or support.

Please do not use this repo long term, but switch back to upstream's versions as soon as they become available. I will be archiving the whole repo after I am done with it.
